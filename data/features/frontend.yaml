description: "Even the best software can be rejected by users if it's unusable or ugly. That's why we picked a various range of technologies, like Angular 4, Typescript, Material Design and Karma/Protractor. It helps us in creating user interfaces that capture the attention, are pleasant to use and help users to take full advantage of the software underneath."
